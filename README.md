# pipelines
Some simple examples using Jenkins pipelines.

[As you know](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/) we can have two types of pipelines syntax:
- **Declarative** - relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline (2.5 Version) which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems.
- **Scripted** - unlike Declarative, is effectively a general-purpose DSL built with Groovy (were once the standard).
